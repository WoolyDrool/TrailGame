Well howdy there! Welcome to the AAAAAAA parks department! We're so glad you've decided to come help make a difference in our parks system
I'm sure you read all this in orientation, but you're the newest member of our trail maintenance squad. Its your job to pick up and clean trails and campsites here around AAA canyon.
We're happy to welcome anyone to our happy little town...we just wish some creatures would do a little better job at respecting our shared space..hehe

Oh! I'm Ranger Margaret, I'll be training you today. We'll get to know eachother more later, but for now I'm gonna run you through the basics of the job. Don't worry, it'll be fun!

[Movement tutorial]

Ah, feels good to stretch the ole meat carriage eh? But thats just where the fun starts! Lets talk about actually picking up litter

In your work uniform, your overalls have two pockets - left and right. When you come across a piece of litter, you can press E or R to put it in your Left or Right pocket respectively.
Don't worry, we cover your laundry bills! We never said this job was clean, haha! Anyways, litter comes in two varieties - trash or recycling. Trash and recycling are 
deposited either in trash cans or recycling bins. You can empty all the contents of one of your pockets into a deposit point, but its important to only deposit trash in trash cans
and recycling in recycling bins! Items deposited in the wrong container wont count towards your paycheck, so pay attention to what goes in what pocket!


While out on the trail, you're gonna be using a variety of tools to help you get the job done. Lets cover your most important tool, and basically your best friend - the picker!
The picker lets you stab a piece of litter and carry it around on the picker so you don't have to put it in one of your pockets. This let you carry more items, but you can also
specify which item on the picker goes into which bin. 

You'll also encounter downed logs on some of the trails. These are a safety hazard, and need to be cleared so everyone can keep having safe and fun days out here in the canyon.
You have to chop the logs into smaller bits using your hatchet so you can carry them. They're too big for your pockets, so you'll have to bring them back to a deposit point by hand. You don't need to
put them in a bin, you can just leave them in a pile and someone will come grab them at the end of the day.

Some of the litter has been here for a while, so you'll need to dig it up out of the dirt to be able to grab it. Use your shovel to excavate them and either put them in your
pocket or stab them with your picker. You also might find goodies or trinkets hidden in the ground, so be on the lookout for dirt mounds!
